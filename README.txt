Notebook

The notebook in this repository provides code for training the YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset of banana leaf nutrient deficiencies. It includes instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Android Studio Application

The Android Studio application, written in Java, is designed to detect and classify the type of nutrient deficiency of a banana leaf in real-time. It utilizes the trained YOLOv5 model to perform inference on images captured by the device's camera.

Post-training Quantization

Post-training quantization techniques are implemented in the notebook to reduce the size of the trained YOLOv5 model. This optimization is crucial for efficient performance, especially when deploying the model on resource-constrained IoT devices.

Research Paper

The research paper included in this repository provides comprehensive insights into the motivation, methodology, and results of the project. It discusses the challenges, solutions, and implications of using deep learning for nutrient deficiency detection in banana crops.
